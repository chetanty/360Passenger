## Inspiration
GeoGuessr and history serve as central inspirations for this project. The ability to look around adds a new level of immersiveness that normal photos cannot compete with.

## What it does
It allows users to experience life in five different cities in 1923. The program uses AI-generated images and Three.js to provide a 360-degree experience. Information about the cities is primarily delivered using JavaScript.

## How I built it
I utilized Three.js, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to bring the project to life. While the foundation was laid by these languages, I applied my image editing skills to stitch the images, making it easy on the eyes.

## Challenges I ran into
Incorporating a 360-degree image into a website was challenging, especially since I hadn't done this before. There were very few documents available on this topic, so I invested a significant amount of time testing different APIs. Eventually, I gained an understanding of Three.js and A-frame, which helped me achieve my target.

## What we learned
Working with 360-degree images was a completely new skill that I am now comfortable incorporating into my future projects

## What's next for 360Passenger
The next steps include adding more cities, enhancing the quality of images, incorporating AI-generated videos, and improving the overall experience as the AI image industry continues to advance.
